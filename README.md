#ü´Ä Classification of Arrhythmia

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify various types of cardiac arrhythmias using ECG data. The trained model is deployed as a web application for real-time prediction. This repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, deployment using Flask, and a Dockerfile for containerization.

üöÄ Technologies Used

    Python: Core language for all processing and development

    Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations

    Matplotlib: Visualizations

    Scikit-learn: ML tools (imputation, scaling, PCA, SVM)

    Imbalanced-learn: RandomOverSampler to handle class imbalance

    Flask: Lightweight web framework for app deployment

    Pickle: Model and object serialization

    Docker: Containerized deployment

    HTML: Frontend templates

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

    Data Preprocessing

        Missing values are imputed using the mean strategy.

        Outlier corrections (e.g., unrealistic height values) are applied.

    Class Imbalance Handling

        RandomOverSampler is used to balance class distribution.

    Feature Engineering

        StandardScaler is used for scaling.

        PCA is applied to retain 98% of the variance.

    Model Training

        A Kernel SVM (RBF) classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset.

    Model Persistence

        The trained model, PCA, and scaler are saved using pickle:

            final_model.pkl

            scaler.pkl

            pca.pkl

    Web Deployment

        A Flask app loads the pickled model, PCA, and scaler to predict arrhythmia classes from uploaded CSV files via a user-friendly interface.

üß™ How to Use
üìÅ Prerequisites
